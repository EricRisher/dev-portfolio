General Design Notes
Color Scheme & Typography: Use a strong, simple color scheme and clear, readable typography. Ensure visual hierarchy is well-established for easy navigation of content.
Animations & Interactions: Employ subtle animations for loading elements or on hover, but ensure they enhance the user experience rather than distract.
Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the design adapts well to mobile devices, possibly reintroducing the hamburger menu for compact navigation.
